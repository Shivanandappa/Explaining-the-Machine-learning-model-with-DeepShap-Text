# Explaining-the-Machine-learning-model-with-DeepShap-values

**Objective** Machine learning models are considered as black box model but we can get the better insights with Explanaible AI libraries like DeepShap
created a classification model for Sentimental Analysis

SHAP does a great job of decoding the influence of the input variables in the predictions. SHAP values calculate the importance of a feature by comparing what a model predicts with and without the feature
